1) what is MongoDb?
    MongoDb is a open source document oriented NOSQL databases used for high 
    volume data storage. Instead of using tables and rows as in traditional relational
    databases mongodb uses collections and documents. 

    Collection - A group of mongodb documents.
    document - A way to organize and store data as a set of field-value pairs.


2) What are the advantages of mongodb?
    *)MongoDB supports field, range-based, string pattern matching type queries
    for searching the data in the database 
    *)MongoDB support primary and secondary index on any fields.
    *)MongoDB has inbuilt support for data partitioning (Sharding).
    *)MongoDB uses a dynamic database schema.


3) What are some features of MongoDB?
    *) Indexing: It supports generic secondary indexes and provides unique, compound, 
        geospatial, and full-text indexing capabilities as well.
    *) Aggregation: It provides an aggregation framework based on the concept of data processing pipelines.
    *) Special collection and index types: It supports time-to-live (TTL) collections for data 
        that should expire at a certain time
    *) File storage: It supports an easy-to-use protocol for storing large files and file metadata.
    *) Sharding: Sharding is the process of splitting data up across machines.


4) What is MongoShell?
    It is  Javascript shell that allows interaction with mongoDb instance from command line.


5) What is Indexing ?
    Indexing is basically a technique that helps in reducing the search time of database query or it helps in faster
    accessing the database.
    It supports efficient execution of queries in mongodb.

6) Explain Sharding ?
    Sharding is a type of database partioning in which large database is divided or partitioned into 
    smaller data and different nodes. These shards are not only smaller but also faster.

    Sharding is the process of splitting data up across machines. We also use the term "partioning".
    we can store more data and handle more load without requiring large or more powerful machines.


7) How does MongoDB store data?
    MongoDB stores data in BSON (Binary JSON) format, a binary-encoded serialization of JSON-like documents.
    These documents are stored in collections within databases.


8) What is a primary key in MongoDB?
    In MongoDB, the `_id` field serves as the primary key for a document. 
    It must be unique within a collection and is automatically generated if not provided during document insertion.


9) What is a replica set in MongoDB?
    It is a group of servers that maintain the same data. To keep identical copies of your data on multiple servers.
    It provides data redundancy and high availability. One server acts as the primary, 
    while others are secondary servers that replicate data from the primary.


10) What are the data types supported by MongoDB?
    MongoDB supports various data types, including string, number, boolean, date, array, object, null, 
    regex, and more. It also helps geospatial and binary data types.


11) What is a cursor in MongoDB, and when is it used?
    A cursor in MongoDB is an iterator to retrieve and process documents from query results. 
    Cursors are used when fetching large result sets, allowing you to retrieve documents in batches.


12) Can you explain the concept of data modeling in MongoDB?
    Data modeling in MongoDB involves designing the structure of your documents and collections 
    to represent your data best and meet your application's requirements. It includes defining document 
    schemas, relationships, and indexing strategies.


13) Aggregation in MongoDb?
    MongoDB's aggregation framework is a powerful tool designed for processing and transforming 
    documents within a collection. It is based on concept of a pipeline.
    We pass the documents from that collection through one or more stages each of which performs
    different operation on its inputs. Each stage takes input from the previous stage output.


14) What are the main features of MongoDB? 
    *) flexibility in data modeling, 
    *) horizontal scalability, 
    *) support for unstructured data, 
    *) powerful query language, 
    *) automatic sharding, 
    *) high availability with replica sets.


15)  What is the purpose of using MongoDB over other databases?
    MongoDB is chosen over other databases for its ability to handle flexible, unstructured, and rapidly changing data. 
    It excels in scenarios where scalability, speed, and agility are essential, such as web and mobile applications, 
    real-time analytics, and content management systems. Its horizontal scaling capabilities also make it suitable 
    for large-scale data storage and processing.


16) What are the different types of indexes in MongoDB?
    MongoDB supports various indexes, including single-field indexes, compound indexes, geospatial indexes, 
    text indexes, hashed indexes, and wildcard indexes.


17) How do you scale a MongoDB database?
    You can scale MongoDB horizontally by adding more servers to a cluster, vertically by upgrading server hardware,
    or by using sharding to distribute data across multiple servers in a sharded cluster.


18) How do you implement security in MongoDB?
    MongoDB provides a range of security capabilities, including authentication, role-based access control (RBAC), 
    SSL/TLS encryption, auditing, and network security, ensuring data safeguarding and preventing unauthorized access.



19) How do you optimize query performance in MongoDB?
    You can optimize query performance by creating appropriate indexes, using the Aggregation Pipeline, 
    minimizing the number of queries, and optimizing query patterns to leverage the query planner.
