1) What is Node Js?
	Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows
	developers to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It is built on Chrome's V8
	JavaScript engine, which makes it fast and efficient. 
	Key Features of Node.js:
	Event-driven, non-blocking I/O model:
	Node.js uses an event-driven architecture, which means that it can handle multiple requests 
	concurrently without blocking the execution of other code. This makes it ideal for building high-performance, scalable applications.
