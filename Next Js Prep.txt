1. What is Next.js?
    Next.js is an open-source web development React-based framework created by Vercel, which is famous for its
    unique features such as Server-side rendering and enhanced SEO. It has some additional features such as
    data fetching utilities, dynamic API routes, optimized builds, etc. It is a framework built upon React, Webpack, and Babel.

2. How Next is different from other JavaScript frameworks?
    Next.js is a JavaScript framework that is primarily designed for building React applications. 
    Here are some key ways in which Next.js differs from other JavaScript frameworks:

    *)Server-Side Rendering (SSR): One of the significant distinctions of Next.js is its built-in support for server-side rendering. 
        This allows pages to be rendered on the server rather than the client, providing benefits like improved SEO and faster initial page loads.
    *)Automatic Code Splitting: Next.js automatically splits the JavaScript code into smaller chunks, allowing for efficient loading of only the
        necessary code for a particular page.
    *)API Routes: Next.js makes it easy to create API routes within the same project, simplifying the development of backend functionality alongside the frontend.
    *)Built-in Image Optimization: The next/image component provides built-in support for image optimization, handling tasks like lazy loading 
        and responsive images without the need for additional configuration.
    *)Easy Deployment: Next.js simplifies the deployment process with various options, including static site hosting, serverless deployment, and more. 
        This ease of deployment is not always as straightforward in other frameworks.
