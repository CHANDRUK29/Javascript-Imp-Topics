1) What is SQL?
    SQL stands for Structured Query Language. 
    SQL is a standard language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data in relational databases.


2) What are the usages of SQL?
    SQL is responsible for maintaining the relational data and the data structures present in the database. 
    Some of the common usages are given below:
        To execute queries against a database
        To retrieve data from a database
        To inserts records in a database
        To updates records in a database
        To delete records from a database
        To create new databases
        To create new tables in a database
        To create views in a database
        To perform complex operations on the database.

3) What is the purpose of DDL Language?
    DDL stands for Data definition language. It is the subset of a database that defines the 
    data structure of the database when the database is created. 


4) What is the purpose of DDL Language?
    DDL stands for Data definition language. It is the subset of a database that defines the 
    data structure of the database when the database is created. 


5) What is the purpose of DCL Language?
    Data control language allows users to control access and permission management to the database.
    (E.G) grant and revoke acess.


6) What are tables and fields in the database?
    A table is a set of organized data in the form of rows and columns. 
    It enables users to store and display records in the structure format. 


7) What is Primary Key?
    The PRIMARY KEY constraint uniquely identifies each record in a table. 
    Primary keys must contain UNIQUE values, and cannot contain NULL values. 
    A table can have only ONE primary key.


8) What is Foriegn Key?
    A FOREIGN KEY is a field (or collection of fields) in one table, that refers
    to the PRIMARY KEY in another table. The table with the foreign key is called
    the child table, and the table with the primary key is called the referenced 
    or parent table.


9)  What is a unique key?
    A unique key is a single or combination of fields that ensure all values 
    stores in the column will be unique. It means a column cannot stores duplicate values.


10) What is the difference between a primary key and a unique key?
    Primary Key:
        The primary key act as a unique identifier for each record in the table.
        We cannot store NULL values in the primary key column.
        We cannot change or delete the primary key column values.

    Unique Key:
        The unique key is also a unique identifier for records when the primary key is not present in the table.
        We can store NULL value in the unique key column, but only one NULL is allowed.
        We can modify the unique key column values.


11) What is a Database?
    A database is an organized collection of data that is structured into tables, rows, columns, and indexes. 
    It helps the user to find the relevant information frequently.


12) What is DBMS?
    DBMS stands for Database Management System. 
    It is a software program that primarily functions as an interface between the database and the end-user.


13) Normalization Vs Denormalization?
    Normalization:
        Divides data into smaller tables to reduce redundancy and ensure data integrity. 
        This process involves transforming and scaling data to a common format and range.
        Normalization is also known as data pre-processing. 

    Denormalization:
        Combines data from multiple tables into fewer, larger tables to improve data retrieval performance. 
        This process involves breaking normalization rules and adding redundant data to a database. 


14) what is Index in sql?
    Indexes are a powerful tool used in the background of a database to speed up querying. 
    Indexes power queries by providing a method to quickly lookup the requested data.


15) What is Constraints in sql?
    In a database table, we can add rules to a column known as constraints. 
    These rules control the data that can be stored in a column.

    The constraints used in SQL are:
        *) NOT NULL : values cannot be null
        *) UNIQUE : does not allows duplicate entry
        *) PRIMARY KEY : USed as a unique iddentifier in table.
        *) FORIEGN KEY : references a row in another table
        *) CHECK : validates condition for new value
        *) DEFAULT : set default value if not passed
        *) CREATE INDEX	: used to speed up the read process.

16) Which are joins in SQL? 
    SQL joins are used to retrieve data from multiple tables into a meaningful result set.
    Joins are used to merge two tables or retrieve data from tables. It depends on the relationship between tables.

    Types:
        *) Inner Join :  Returns records that have matching values in both tables
        *) Left Join : Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
        *) Right Join : Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
        *) Full Join : Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table.
        *) Self Join : A self join is a regular join, but the table is joined with itself.
        *) Cross Join : The CROSS JOIN keyword all matching records from both tables whether the other table matches or not.


17) What are the set operators in SQL?
    We use the set operators to merge data from one or more tables of the same kind.

    The set operators in SQL are categories into four different types:
        A. UNION: It combines two or more results from multiple SELECT queries into a single result set. 
                    It has a default feature to remove the duplicate rows from the tables.
        B. UNION ALL: This operator is similar to the Union operator, but it does not remove the duplicate
                    rows from the output of the SELECT statements.
        C. INTERSECT: This operator returns the common records from two or more SELECT statements. 
                    It always retrieves unique records and arranges them in ascending order by default.
        D. MINUS: This operator returns the records from the first query, which is not found in the second query.
                    It does not return duplicate values.
